# Smart Garage Parking Assistant

This project demonstrates a Smart Garage Parking Assistant built using the Benewake TFmini Plus LiDAR sensor and a WS2812B RGB LED strip.  
It takes up no floor space while maintaining a sleek, modern design.

The system measures the distance between the top of the car and the ceiling-mounted LiDAR sensor.  
As the car moves forward, the detected distance decreases because higher parts of the vehicle (like the windshield or roof) approach the sensor.  

This change correlates to the carâ€™s closing distance toward the wall â€” providing color-based LED guidance in real time.

## LED Feedback Logic

| LED Color | Condition | Meaning |
|------------|------------|----------|
| ðŸŸ© Green | Distance < 100 in (254 cm) | Safe distance â€” hood of car |
| ðŸŸ§ Yellow / Orange | Distance < 83 in (210.82 cm) OR Distance == 0 | Getting close â€” Distance feeback is 0 when sensor detects windshield|
| ðŸŸ¥ Red | Distance < 66 in (167.64 cm) | Perfect parking range |

After the car remains parked for several seconds, the LED strip automatically turns off to conserve power.  
When the car moves again, the system detects motion and reactivates LED feedback.
